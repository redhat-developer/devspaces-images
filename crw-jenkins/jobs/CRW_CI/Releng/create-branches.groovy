This job is meant to be run after upstream deps are available to start the new crw-2.y-rhel-8 github branches for the upcoming release.
<p>
See <a href=https://github.com/redhat-developer/codeready-workspaces/blob/crw-2-rhel-8/product/tagRelease.sh>
https://github.com/redhat-developer/codeready-workspaces/blob/crw-2-rhel-8/product/tagRelease.sh</a>

<p>To create branches of pkgs.devel repos, open a ticket like <a href=https://projects.engineering.redhat.com/browse/SPMM-4820>SPMM-4820</a>

  <p>NOTE: this job is not meant to create tags in repos, as branching occurs BEFORE GA, and tagging occurs AFTER.
