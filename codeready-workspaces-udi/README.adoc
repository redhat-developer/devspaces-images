For odo check required versions at https://github.com/redhat-developer/vscode-openshift-tools/releases
 and https://github.com/redhat-developer/vscode-openshift-tools/blob/master/src/tools.json
 note: as of 0.1.5 win/lin/mac binaries are included in the vsix (no plan to include s390x and ppc64le)

To get the correct version of odo from upstream
```
 toolsJson="https://github.com/redhat-developer/vscode-openshift-tools/raw/master/src/tools.json"
 curl -sSL $toolsJson -o - |	 jq ".odo.platform.linux.url" -r | sed -r -e "s#.+/clients/odo/v(.+)/odo.+#\1#"
```
