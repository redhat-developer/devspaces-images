## Che/CodeReady Workspaces Operator Metadata

This repo contains necessary metadata for a new channel which will initially be available as a Technical Preview. In future, it will replace the 'latest' channel from the codeready-workspaces-operator-metadata container and become the new default.

For the golang application that is the CRW Operator, see
