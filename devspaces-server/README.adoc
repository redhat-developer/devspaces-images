Links marked with this icon :door: are _internal to Red Hat_. This includes Jenkins servers, job configs in gitlab, and container sources in dist-git. 

Because these services are internal, in the interest of making all things open, we've copied as much as possible into the link:https://github.com/redhat-developer/devspaces-images[devspaces-images] repo.

## What's inside?

NOTE: The so-called master branch is deprecated and is no longer kept up to date. Instead, the latest nightly sources are in **devspaces-3-rhel-8 branch**, synced to upstream projects' main (or master) branches.

For the latest stable release, see the **devspaces-3.y-rhel-8** branch with the largest y value.


## How to build locally

1. Sync code from upstream using `build/scripts/sync.sh`.

2. Build the Server assembly with maven 3.6 and JDK 11:
+
```
mvn clean install -Dmaven.repo.local=.repository/ -V -B -e -DskipTests # -Pintegration
mv assembly/assembly-main/target/eclipse-che-*.tar.gz asset-server.tgz
```
+
3. Build the Server image using `Dockerfile`. Note that you will need to change one line to resolve the base image:
```
-FROM ubi8-minimal
+FROM registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8-minimal
```

## How to build in Brew

1. To build in Brew, see the `get-sources*.sh` script, which will:

* build the Che server assembly (step 2),
* trigger a Brew build using that tarball.

### A note about SVG files 

If using Inkscape to save files, make sure you export as *Plain SVG*, then edit the resulting .svg file to remove any `<metadata>...</metadata>` tags and all their contents. You can also remove the `xmlns:rdf` definition. This will ensure they compile correctly.
