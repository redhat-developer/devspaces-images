Links marked with this icon :door: are _internal to Red Hat_. This includes Jenkins servers, job configs in gitlab, and container sources in dist-git. 

Because these services are internal, in the interest of making all things open, we've copied as much as possible into the link:https://github.com/redhat-developer/codeready-workspaces-images[codeready-workspaces-images] repo.

## What's inside?

NOTE: The so-called master branch is deprecated and is no longer kept up to date. Instead, the latest nightly sources are in **crw-2-rhel-8 branch**, synced to upstream projects' main (or master) branches.

For the latest stable release, see the **crw-2.y-rhel-8** branch with the largest y value.


## How to build locally

1. Sync code from upstream using `build/scripts/sync.sh`.

2. Build the Dashboard image using `build/dockerfiles/rhel.Dockerfile`.

## How to build in Brew

1. To build in Brew, see the `get-sources*.sh` script, which will:

* build the dashboard image locally, extract the yarn cache into a tarball, then
* trigger a Brew build using that tarball.

## Branding

Branding is currently in two places.

### A note about SVG files 

If using Inkscape to save files, make sure you export as *Plain SVG*, then edit the resulting .svg file to remove any `<metadata>...</metadata>` tags and all their contents. You can also remove the `xmlns:rdf` definition. This will ensure they compile correctly.
